NerdTracker II (NT2) is a music tracker from NRU Software, available
by email from Memblers <5010.0951@tcon.net>.  Replay code exists to
play NT2 modules (called NED files) on NES hardware; NT2 is very
popular among NES demo musicians.  Many homebrew NSF tracks are based
on the NT2 system.

One day I got bored and decided to reverse-engineer the format of a
NED file.  I created a file dumper.  Armed with this disinformation
(ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY is provided), it is possible to create replay
code for platforms other than NES.


== Structure of the NED file ==

off     size
   0      52(??)NT2 NED header (stripped when writing to .dat)
  52(??)  ???   NED temp.dat data

The sample data has not yet been reversed.


== Structure of the NED temp.dat file ==

off     size
   0      16    NED sequence header
  16     128    Instruments
 144       4*o  Order table
 144+4o    2*p0 Pattern offsets for square 1
 ...       2*p1 Pattern offsets for square 2
 ...       2*p2 Pattern offsets for triangle
 ...       2*p3 Pattern offsets for noise
 ...       2*p4 Pattern offsets for sample
 ...     ...    Pattern data


== NT2 NED header ==

Has not been reversed.  I'll have to use black box RE techniques
to get at this, as the source code for nt2.exe is not available.


== The NED sequence header ==

The replay code does not use NED files but instead temp.dat files.

 0  NED_NedAddr points here
 0  version (always 0x20)
 1  header size (always 0x10)
 2  flags (???)
 3  initial ticks per row (always 0x06 in NT2-produced files)
 4  loop point in song
 5  number of instruments (always 0x10)
 6  number of DPCM instruments
 7  song length
 8  number of squarewave1 patterns
 9  number of squarewave2 patterns
10  number of triangle patterns
11  number of noise patterns
12  number of sample patterns
13-15 filler
16  NED_InstAddr points here


== Instruments ==

Each instrument is eight bytes.  Information marked with a (?) has
not been fully verified against a real NED file.

 0  76543210
    `+|`---+- always 10000
     |+------ note length (bit 7)
     +------- tone
 1  automatic pitchbending
 2  auto FM
 3  auto AM
 4  76543210
    |`-----+- note length (bits 6-0)
    +-------- decay direction (0 down, 1 up)

 5  76543210
    `--+`--+- decay rate
       +----- initial volume
 6  76543210
    ||| `--+- arpeggio Z
    ||+------ nonlooped arpeggio
    |+------- use 93-bit noise waveform
    +-------- arpeggio direction (0 up, 1 down) (?)
 7  76543210
    `--+`--+- arpeggio X
       +----- arpeggio Y


Order table

NED_OrderAddr points to a list of 32-bit little-endian integers:

11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000
fedcba98 76543210 fedcba98 76543210
       `----+`----+`---+`----+`---+- square 1
            |     |    |     +------ square 2 pattern
            |     |    +------------ triangle pattern
            |     +----------------- noise pattern
            +----------------------- sample pattern


Pattern pointers

Each two-byte pattern pointer is an offset from NED_NedAddr to
pattern data.


Pattern data

00 ???
01 number of rows used, minus 1
02 bit pattern (nibbles, LITTLE-endian)
   d0: note
   d1: inst
   d2: effect
   d3: effect data
then data (starting on a byte boundary)

Note data is a stream of nibbles.  The most confusing part is that
the nibble ordering for whole bytes is not the same as the nibble
ordering for split bytes.  Apparently, it works like this:

pullbyte()
{
  if(on even boundary)
    return getnextbyte();
  else
    return (getnextnibble() << 4) | getnextnibble();
}

A note number is an offset from C-0 (middle C is C-3 on square or
C-4 on triangle).

Examples:
  12 is F-1
  3/A is instrument
  4 is effect
  56 is effect data

All notes on, starting on even nibble boundary:
12 43 56

Only note, starting on even nibble boundary:
12

Note and instrument, twice:
12 13 32


== Effects and their parameters ==

1xx     Portamento up, x = speed
2xx     Portamento down, x = speed
3xx     Portamento to basenote, x = speed
4xy     FM, x = speed, y = depth
7xy     AM, x = speed, y = depth
8xy     Arpeggio, x and y semitones above basenote
Axy     Volume Slide, x = up, y = down
Cxx     Set volume, maximum is $3f (NES ignores 2 lsb)
D00     Go to next pattern
Fxx     Set speed (50/xx rows per second)


== Example source code ==

An NT2 temp.dat dumper (nt2dump.c) is included with this document;
for best results, compile it with DJGPP:

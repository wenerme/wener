# iOS Kiosk Mode

- [How to Turn an iPad into a Kiosk](https://www.howtogeek.com/252670/)

## Guided Access vs. Single App Mode

- **Guided Access**: Temporarily lock an iPad to a single app. Good for temporary kiosks or parental control.
  - `Settings > General > Accessibility > Guided Access`
- **Single App Mode**: Lock a supervised iPad to a single app. Good for dedicated kiosks.
  - `Apple Configurator > Supervised Mode`
  - `Actions > Advanced > Start Single App Mode`

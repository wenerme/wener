# STM32 Microcontrollers

STM32 is a family of 32-bit microcontrollers based on the ARM Cortex-M processor, produced by STMicroelectronics.

## Core Architectures

The STM32 family covers various performance levels:

- **Cortex-M7F**: High-performance (STM32H7, STM32F7).
- **Cortex-M4F**: Mainstream with Floating Point Unit (STM32F4, STM32L4).
- **Cortex-M3**: Standard performance (STM32F1, STM32F2, STM32L1).
- **Cortex-M0 / M0+**: Entry-level and low-power (STM32F0, STM32L0, STM32G0).

## Development Ecosystem

### Hardware Tools

- **Nucleo Boards**: Low-cost development boards with Arduino-compatible headers.
- **Discovery Kits**: Feature-rich boards with onboard sensors, displays, and debuggers.
- **ST-LINK**: The official hardware debugger and programmer.

### Software Tools

- **STM32CubeMX**: Graphical tool for MCU configuration and initialization code generation.
- **STM32CubeIDE**: All-in-one multi-OS development tool based on Eclipse/GCC.
- **PlatformIO**: Modern, VSCode-based ecosystem for embedded development.
- **Keil MDK / IAR EWARM**: High-end commercial IDEs.

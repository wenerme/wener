灵活工作时间都是骗人的
晚来晚走可以,早来早走是不行的.

工作时间是非常有限的
我自己的工作时间举例
早上七点半起
一个小时地铁 - 9
两个小时清醒 - 11
一个小时午餐 - 1
开始一天工作 - 6
一个小时地铁 - 8
晚上睡觉时间 - 12

并且在公司上班会被不停的打断

The open office plan is a tyrant of interruption, a deep loss of privacy, and the death of productivity

工作都是以坐在坐在座位上为准,而不关心你具体做了多少东西.

Money is not Evil by itself. It's just paper with
perceived value, to obtain other things we
value in other ways. If not Money, what is Evil..
.. you may ask?

Evil is the unconscionable, obsessive, and
moral bending desire for more. Evil is the
bottomless, soulless and obsessive compulsive
pursuit of some pot of gold at the end of some
rainbow which doesn't exist.

Evil is having a price-tag for your heart and soul in
exchange for financial success at any cost. Evil is
trying to buy happiness again and again until all
those fake short-lived mirages of emotions are gone.

I'm not saying you can't be financially successful.
I'm saying: Have a greater purpose in life, well beyond
the pursuit of financial success. Your soul is screaming
for you to answer your TRUE calling.

You can change today, if you redefine what success is to You.
You can transform your damaged relationships and build new ones.
You can forgive yourself, and others who have hurt you.

You can become a leader by mentoring with others
who you'd aspire to be like.
You can re-balance your priorities in life. You can heal your marriage
AND recreate a stronger love that you ever thought possible.
You can become the best parent possible at any age even 86.
But don't wait until then.
You'll always be able to make more money.

But you cannot..
..make more time.

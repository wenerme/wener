# HTPC (Home Theater PC) & Small Form Factor Chassis

Notes on Home Theater PCs and specialized compact chassis used for media centers, industrial controllers, or home servers.

## Featured Chassis: X7 All-Aluminum Case (X7 全铝机箱)

A compact, highly customizable aluminum chassis often used for industrial control or specialized HTPC builds.

### Standard Configuration (标配)

1. **X7 All-Aluminum Chassis**: Usually comes with a default panel (no serial ports).
2. **PCI Adapter Bracket**: For mounting low-profile expansion cards.
3. **Screw Kit**: Necessary mounting hardware.
4. **Independent Packaging**: For shipping safety.

### Optional Accessories (可选配件)

- **Custom Panels**: Choices of no serial ports, 5 serial ports, or 9 serial ports (ideal for industrial COM port density).
- **Cooling**: Supports 4010 small fans for active airflow.
- **Mounting**: Supports vertical desktop stands or wall-mount brackets.
- **Power Solution**: Often requires a **DC-ATX (PicoPSU)** plug-in power module (65W - 120W+).
- **PCI Integration**: PCI riser cables (ribbon cables) for horizontal GPU or card mounting.

## Typical HTPC Build Components

- **Motherboard**: Thin-ITX or Mini-ITX form factors.
- **CPU**: Low TDP processors (Intel T-series or AMD GE-series) to minimize heat in small spaces.
- **GPU**: Integrated graphics (iGPU) are usually sufficient for 4K video playback.
- **Storage**: M.2 NVMe SSDs to save physical space and reduce cable clutter.
- **Software**:
  - **Kodi / CoreELEC**: Dedicated media center interfaces.
  - **Plex / Emby / Jellyfin**: Media server systems.

## Key Considerations

- **Acoustics**: HTPCs should be silent; prioritize fanless designs or high-quality silent fans.
- **Form Factor**: Ensure the chassis height fits in a standard TV cabinet shelf.
- **Thermal Management**: Aluminum cases act as large heatsinks, which is beneficial for passive cooling.

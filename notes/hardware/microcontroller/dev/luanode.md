# LuaNode (Lua SDK for ESP8266/ESP32)

LuaNode is an asynchronous, event-driven Lua SDK for ESP8266 and ESP32, heavily inspired by Node.js. It allows developers to write Lua code to interact with hardware peripherals and network services.

    - Asynchronous event-driven Lua SDK for ESP8266 and ESP32.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous I/O**: Non-blocking network and peripheral operations.
- **Node.js Style**: Familiar programming model for web developers.
- **Multi-protocol Support**: Handles TCP, UDP, HTTP, and MQTT.
- **Hardware Integration**: Easy access to GPIO, PWM, I2C, and UART.

## Comparison with NodeMCU

- **Architecture**: While both use Lua, LuaNode focuses on a more modern, event-driven architecture similar to Node.js, whereas NodeMCU is a more traditional Lua firmware wrapper for the ESP SDK.
- **Portability**: LuaNode was designed with greater portability between different ESP architectures in mind.

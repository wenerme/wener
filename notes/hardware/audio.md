# Audio Hardware & Digital Sound

An overview of audio hardware, digital signal processing (DSP), and common transmission protocols.

## Digital Audio Formats

- **PCM (Pulse Code Modulation)**: The raw digital representation of an analog signal.
- **WAV/AIFF**: Uncompressed containers for PCM.
- **FLAC/ALAC**: Lossless compression.
- **MP3/AAC/OGG**: Lossy compression.

## Audio Hardware Components

- **DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)**: Converts digital bits into an analog voltage for speakers.
- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**: Converts microphone signals into digital bits for processing.
- **DSP (Digital Signal Processor)**: Specialized microprocessor for audio/signal manipulation.
- **Op-Amp (Operational Amplifier)**: Used for signal amplification and filtering.

## Hardare Protocols & Interfaces

- **I2S (Inter-IC Sound)**: Serial bus used to connect digital audio devices together (e.g., CPU to DAC).
- **S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface)**: Consumer-grade digital interconnect (Optical/Coax).
- **AES3**: Professional digital audio standard.
- **MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)**: Control protocol for musical devices.
- **USB Audio**: Class-compliant interface for external sound cards.

## Common Standards

- **Sample Rate**: kHz (e.g., 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz).
- **Bit Depth**: Resolution (e.g., 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit float).
- **dynamic Range**: The ratio between the loudest and quietest sounds.

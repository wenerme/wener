Use replicaof to make a Redis instance a copy of\n# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.\n#\n#   +------------------+      +---------------+\n#   |      Master      | ---\x3e |    Replica    |\n#   | (receive writes) |      |  (exact copy) |\n#   +------------------+      +---------------+\n#\n# 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to\n#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least\n#    a given number of replicas.\n# 2) Redis replicas are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the\n#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of\n#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next\n#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.\n# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a\n#    network partition replicas automatically try to reconnect to masters\n#    and resynchronize with them.\n#\n# replicaof <masterip> <masterport>\n\n# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration\n# directive below) it is possible to tell the replica to authenticate before\n# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will\n# refuse the replica request.\n#\n# masterauth <master-password>\n#\n# However this is not enough if you are using Redis ACLs (for Redis version\n# 6 or greater), and the default user is not capable of running the PSYNC\n# command and/or other commands needed for replication. In this case it\'s\n# better to configure a special user to use with replication, and specify the\n# masteruser configuration as such:\n#\n# masteruser <username>\n#\n# When masteruser is specified, the replica will authenticate against its\n# master using the new AUTH form: AUTH <username> <password>.\n\n# When a replica loses its connection with the master, or when the replication\n# is still in progress, the replica can act in two different ways:\n#\n# 1) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to \'yes\' (the default) the replica will\n#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the\n#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.\n#\n# 2) If replica-serve-stale-data is set to \'no\' the replica will reply with error\n#    "MASTERDOWN Link with MASTER is down and replica-serve-stale-data is set to \'no\'"\n#    to all data access commands, excluding commands such as:\n#    INFO, REPLICAOF, AUTH, SHUTDOWN, REPLCONF, ROLE, CONFIG, SUBSCRIBE,\n#    UNSUBSCRIBE, PSUBSCRIBE, PUNSUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, PUBSUB, COMMAND, POST,\n#    HOST and LATENCY.\n#\nreplica-serve-stale-data yes\n\n# You can configure a replica instance to accept writes or not. Writing against\n# a replica instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data\n# written on a replica will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but\n# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a\n# misconfiguration.\n#\n# Since Redis 2.6 by default replicas are read-only.\n#\n# Note: read only replicas are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients\n# on the internet. It\'s just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.\n# Still a read only replica exports by default all the administrative commands\n# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve\n# security of read only replicas using \'rename-command\' to shadow all the\n# administrative / dangerous commands.\nreplica-read-only yes\n\n# Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.\n#\n# New replicas and reconnecting replicas that are not able to continue the\n# replication process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a\n# "full synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the\n# replicas.\n#\n# The transmission can happen in two different ways:\n#\n# 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB\n#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent\n#                 process to the replicas incrementally.\n# 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the\n#              RDB file to replica sockets, without touching the disk at all.\n#\n# With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more replicas\n# can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child\n# producing the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead\n# once the transfer starts, new replicas arriving will be queued and a new\n# transfer will start when the current one terminates.\n#\n# When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of\n# time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple\n# replicas will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.\n#\n# With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication\n# works better.\nrepl-diskless-sync yes\n\n# When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay\n# the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket\n# to the replicas.\n#\n# This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve\n# new replicas arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the\n# server waits a delay in order to let more replicas arrive.\n#\n# The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable\n# it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.\nrepl-diskless-sync-delay 5\n\n# When diskless replication is enabled with a delay, it is possible to let\n# the replication start before the maximum delay is reached if the maximum\n# number of replicas expected have connected. Default of 0 means that the\n# maximum is not defined and Redis will wait the full delay.\nrepl-diskless-sync-max-replicas 0\n\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# WARNING: Since in this setup the replica does not immediately store an RDB on\n# disk, it may cause data loss during failovers.

Replicas in this mode can keep serving current\n#                 dataset while replication is in progress, except for cases where\n#                 they can\'t recognize master as having a data set from same\n#                 replication history.\n#                 Note that this requires sufficient memory, if you don\'t have it,\n#                 you risk an OOM kill.\n# "on-empty-db" - Use diskless load only when current dataset is empty.

It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a replica to promote\n# into a master if the master is no longer working correctly.\n#\n# A replica with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so\n# for instance if there are three replicas with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel\n# will pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.\n#\n# However a special priority of 0 marks the replica as not able to perform the\n# role of master, so a replica with priority of 0 will never be selected by\n# Redis Sentinel for promotion.\n#\n# By default the priority is 100.\nreplica-priority 100\n\n# The propagation error behavior controls how Redis will behave when it is\n# unable to handle a command being processed in the replication stream from a master\n# or processed while reading from an AOF file. Errors that occur during propagation\n# are unexpected, and can cause data inconsistency. However, there are edge cases\n# in earlier versions of Redis where it was possible for the server to replicate or persist\n# commands that would fail on future versions. For this reason the default behavior\n# is to ignore such errors and continue processing commands.\n#\n# If an application wants to ensure there is no data divergence, this configuration\n# should be set to \'panic\' instead. The value can also be set to \'panic-on-replicas\'\n# to only panic when a replica encounters an error on the replication stream. One of\n# these two panic values will become the default value in the future once there are\n# sufficient safety mechanisms in place to prevent false positive crashes.\n#\n# propagation-error-behavior ignore\n\n# Replica ignore disk write errors controls the behavior of a replica when it is\n# unable to persist a write command received from its master to disk. By default,\n# this configuration is set to \'no\' and will crash the replica in this condition.\n# It is not recommended to change this default, however in order to be compatible\n# with older versions of Redis this config can be toggled to \'yes\' which will just\n# log a warning and execute the write command it got from the master.\n#\n# replica-ignore-disk-write-errors no\n\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# By default, Redis Sentinel includes all replicas in its reports. A replica\n# can be excluded from Redis Sentinel\'s announcements. An unannounced replica\n# will be ignored by the \'sentinel replicas <master>\' command and won\'t be\n# exposed to Redis Sentinel\'s clients.\n#\n# This option does not change the behavior of replica-priority. Even with\n# replica-announced set to \'no\', the replica can be promoted to master. To\n# prevent this behavior, set replica-priority to 0.\n#\n# replica-announced yes\n\n# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than\n# N replicas connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.\n#\n# The N replicas need to be in "online" state.\n#\n# The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from\n# the last ping received from the replica, that is usually sent every second.\n#\n# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but\n# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough replicas\n# are available, to the specified number of seconds.\n#\n# For example to require at least 3 replicas with a lag <= 10 seconds use:\n#\n# min-replicas-to-write 3\n# min-replicas-max-lag 10\n#\n# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.\n#\n# By default min-replicas-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and\n# min-replicas-max-lag is set to 10.\n\n# A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached\n# replicas in different ways. For example the "INFO replication" section\n# offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by\n# Redis Sentinel in order to discover replica instances.\n# Another place where this info is available is in the output of the\n# "ROLE" command of a master.\n#\n# The listed IP address and port normally reported by a replica is\n# obtained in the following way:\n#\n#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address\n#   of the socket used by the replica to connect with the master.\n#\n#   Port: The port is communicated by the replica during the replication\n#   handshake, and is normally the port that the replica is using to\n#   listen for connections.\n#\n# However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is\n# used, the replica may actually be reachable via different IP and port\n# pairs. The following two options can be used by a replica in order to\n# report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO\n# and ROLE will report those values.\n#\n# There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just\n# the port or the IP address.\n#\n# replica-announce-ip 5.5.5.5\n# replica-announce-port 1234\n\n############################### KEYS TRACKING #################################\n\n# Redis implements server assisted support for client side caching of values.\n# This is implemented using an invalidation table that remembers, using\n# a radix key indexed by key name, what clients have which keys. In turn\n# this is used in order to send invalidation messages to clients. Please\n# check this page to understand more about the feature:\n#\n#   https://redis.io/topics/client-side-caching\n#\n# When tracking is enabled for a client, all the read only queries are assumed\n# to be cached: this will force Redis to store information in the invalidation\n# table. When keys are modified, such information is flushed away, and\n# invalidation messages are sent to the clients. However if the workload is\n# heavily dominated by reads, Redis could use more and more memory in order\n# to track the keys fetched by many clients.\n#\n# For this reason it is possible to configure a maximum fill value for the\n# invalidation table. By default it is set to 1M of keys, and once this limit\n# is reached, Redis will start to evict keys in the invalidation table\n# even if they were not modified, just to reclaim memory: this will in turn\n# force the clients to invalidate the cached values. Basically the table\n# maximum size is a trade off between the memory you want to spend server\n# side to track information about who cached what, and the ability of clients\n# to retain cached objects in memory.\n#\n# If you set the value to 0, it means there are no limits, and Redis will\n# retain as many keys as needed in the invalidation table.\n# In the "stats" INFO section, you can find information about the number of\n# keys in the invalidation table at every given moment.\n#\n# Note: when key tracking is used in broadcasting mode, no memory is used\n# in the server side so this setting is useless.\n#\n# tracking-table-max-keys 1000000\n\n################################## SECURITY ###################################\n\n# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast, an outside user can try up to\n# 1 million passwords per second against a modern box. This means that you\n# should use very strong passwords, otherwise they will be very easy to break.\n# Note that because the password is really a shared secret between the client\n# and the server, and should not be memorized by any human, the password\n# can be easily a long string from /dev/urandom or whatever, so by using a\n# long and unguessable password no brute force attack will be possible.\n\n# Redis ACL users are defined in the following format:\n#\n#   user <username> ... acl rules ...\n#\n# For example:\n#\n#   user worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99\n#\n# The special username "default" is used for new connections.

If this directive is\n#               used for the default user, every new connection will be\n#               immediately authenticated with the default user without\n#               any explicit AUTH command required.

However note that the additive\n# and subtractive rules will CHANGE MEANING depending on the ordering.\n# For instance see the following example:\n#\n#   user alice on +@all -DEBUG ~* >somepassword\n#\n# This will allow "alice" to use all the commands with the exception of the\n# DEBUG command, since +@all added all the commands to the set of the commands\n# alice can use, and later DEBUG was removed. However if we invert the order\n# of two ACL rules the result will be different:\n#\n#   user alice on -DEBUG +@all ~* >somepassword\n#\n# Now DEBUG was removed when alice had yet no commands in the set of allowed\n# commands, later all the commands are added, so the user will be able to\n# execute everything.\n#\n# Basically ACL rules are processed left-to-right.\n#\n# The following is a list of command categories and their meanings:\n# * keyspace - Writing or reading from keys, databases, or their metadata\n#     in a type agnostic way. Includes DEL, RESTORE, DUMP, RENAME, EXISTS, DBSIZE,\n#     KEYS, EXPIRE, TTL, FLUSHALL, etc. Commands that may modify the keyspace,\n#     key or metadata will also have `write` category. Commands that only read\n#     the keyspace, key or metadata will have the `read` category.\n# * read - Reading from keys (values or metadata). Note that commands that don\'t\n#     interact with keys, will not have either `read` or `write`.\n# * write - Writing to keys (values or metadata)\n# * admin - Administrative commands. Normal applications will never need to use\n#     these. Includes REPLICAOF, CONFIG, DEBUG, SAVE, MONITOR, ACL, SHUTDOWN, etc.\n# * dangerous - Potentially dangerous (each should be considered with care for\n#     various reasons). This includes FLUSHALL, MIGRATE, RESTORE, SORT, KEYS,\n#     CLIENT, DEBUG, INFO, CONFIG, SAVE, REPLICAOF, etc.\n# * connection - Commands affecting the connection or other connections.\n#     This includes AUTH, SELECT, COMMAND, CLIENT, ECHO, PING, etc.\n# * blocking - Potentially blocking the connection until released by another\n#     command.\n# * fast - Fast O(1) commands. May loop on the number of arguments, but not the\n#     number of elements in the key.\n# * slow - All commands that are not Fast.\n# * pubsub - PUBLISH / SUBSCRIBE related\n# * transaction - WATCH / MULTI / EXEC related commands.\n# * scripting - Scripting related.\n# * set - Data type: sets related.\n# * sortedset - Data type: zsets related.\n# * list - Data type: lists related.\n# * hash - Data type: hashes related.\n# * string - Data type: strings related.\n# * bitmap - Data type: bitmaps related.\n# * hyperloglog - Data type: hyperloglog related.\n# * geo - Data type: geo related.\n# * stream - Data type: streams related.\n#\n# For more information about ACL configuration please refer to\n# the Redis web site at https://redis.io/topics/acl\n\n# ACL LOG\n#\n# The ACL Log tracks failed commands and authentication events associated\n# with ACLs. The ACL Log is useful to troubleshoot failed commands blocked\n# by ACLs. The ACL Log is stored in memory. You can reclaim memory with\n# ACL LOG RESET. Define the maximum entry length of the ACL Log below.\nacllog-max-len 128\n\n# Using an external ACL file\n#\n# Instead of configuring users here in this file, it is possible to use\n# a stand-alone file just listing users. The two methods cannot be mixed:\n# if you configure users here and at the same time you activate the external\n# ACL file, the server will refuse to start.\n#\n# The format of the external ACL user file is exactly the same as the\n# format that is used inside redis.conf to describe users.\n#\n# aclfile /etc/redis/users.acl\n\n# IMPORTANT NOTE: starting with Redis 6 "requirepass" is just a compatibility\n# layer on top of the new ACL system. The option effect will be just setting\n# the password for the default user. Clients will still authenticate using\n# AUTH <password> as usually, or more explicitly with AUTH default <password>\n# if they follow the new protocol: both will work.\n#\n# The requirepass is not compatible with aclfile option and the ACL LOAD\n# command, these will cause requirepass to be ignored.\n#\n# requirepass foobared\n\n# New users are initialized with restrictive permissions by default, via the\n# equivalent of this ACL rule \'off resetkeys -@all\'. Starting with Redis 6.2, it\n# is possible to manage access to Pub/Sub channels with ACL rules as well. The\n# default Pub/Sub channels permission if new users is controlled by the\n# acl-pubsub-default configuration directive, which accepts one of these values:\n#\n# allchannels: grants access to all Pub/Sub channels\n# resetchannels: revokes access to all Pub/Sub channels\n#\n# From Redis 7.0, acl-pubsub-default defaults to \'resetchannels\' permission.\n#\n# acl-pubsub-default resetchannels\n\n# Command renaming (DEPRECATED).\n#\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# WARNING: avoid using this option if possible. Instead use ACLs to remove\n# commands from the default user, and put them only in some admin user you\n# create for administrative purposes.\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#\n# It is possible to change the name of dangerous commands in a shared\n# environment. For instance the CONFIG command may be renamed into something\n# hard to guess so that it will still be available for internal-use tools\n# but not available for general clients.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52\n#\n# It is also possible to completely kill a command by renaming it into\n# an empty string:\n#\n# rename-command CONFIG ""\n#\n# Please note that changing the name of commands that are logged into the\n# AOF file or transmitted to replicas may cause problems.\n\n################################### CLIENTS ####################################\n\n# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default\n# this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not\n# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit\n# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit\n# minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).\n#\n# Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending\n# an error \'max number of clients reached\'.\n#\n# IMPORTANT: When Redis Cluster is used, the max number of connections is also\n# shared with the cluster bus: every node in the cluster will use two\n# connections, one incoming and another outgoing. It is important to size the\n# limit accordingly in case of very large clusters.\n#\n# maxclients 10000\n\n############################## MEMORY MANAGEMENT ################################\n\n# Set a memory usage limit to the specified amount of bytes.\n# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys\n# according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).\n#\n# If Redis can\'t remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is\n# set to \'noeviction\', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands\n# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue\n# to reply to read-only commands like GET.\n#\n# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU or LFU cache, or to\n# set a hard memory limit for an instance (using the \'noeviction\' policy).\n#\n# WARNING: If you have replicas attached to an instance with maxmemory on,\n# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the replicas are subtracted\n# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will\n# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output\n# buffer of replicas is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion\n# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.\n#\n# In short... if you have replicas attached it is suggested that you set a lower\n# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for replica\n# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is \'noeviction\').\n#\n# maxmemory <bytes>\n\n# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory\n# is reached. You can select one from the following behaviors:\n#\n# volatile-lru -> Evict using approximated LRU, only keys with an expire set.\n# allkeys-lru -> Evict any key using approximated LRU.\n# volatile-lfu -> Evict using approximated LFU, only keys with an expire set.\n# allkeys-lfu -> Evict any key using approximated LFU.\n# volatile-random -> Remove a random key having an expire set.\n# allkeys-random -> Remove a random key, any key.\n# volatile-ttl -> Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)\n# noeviction -> Don\'t evict anything, just return an error on write operations.\n#\n# LRU means Least Recently Used\n# LFU means Least Frequently Used\n#\n# Both LRU, LFU and volatile-ttl are implemented using approximated\n# randomized algorithms.\n#\n# Note: with any of the above policies, when there are no suitable keys for\n# eviction, Redis will return an error on write operations that require\n# more memory. These are usually commands that create new keys, add data or\n# modify existing keys. A few examples are: SET, INCR, HSET, LPUSH, SUNIONSTORE,\n# SORT (due to the STORE argument), and EXEC (if the transaction includes any\n# command that requires memory).\n#\n# The default is:\n#\n# maxmemory-policy noeviction\n\n# LRU, LFU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated\n# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or\n# accuracy. By default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was\n# used least recently, you can change the sample size using the following\n# configuration directive.\n#\n# The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely\n# true LRU but costs more CPU. 3 is faster but not very accurate.\n#\n# maxmemory-samples 5\n\n# Eviction processing is designed to function well with the default setting.\n# If there is an unusually large amount of write traffic, this value may need to\n# be increased.  Decreasing this value may reduce latency at the risk of\n# eviction processing effectiveness\n#   0 = minimum latency, 10 = default, 100 = process without regard to latency\n#\n# maxmemory-eviction-tenacity 10\n\n# Starting from Redis 5, by default a replica will ignore its maxmemory setting\n# (unless it is promoted to master after a failover or manually). It means\n# that the eviction of keys will be just handled by the master, sending the\n# DEL commands to the replica as keys evict in the master side.\n#\n# This behavior ensures that masters and replicas stay consistent, and is usually\n# what you want, however if your replica is writable, or you want the replica\n# to have a different memory setting, and you are sure all the writes performed\n# to the replica are idempotent, then you may change this default (but be sure\n# to understand what you are doing).\n#\n# Note that since the replica by default does not evict, it may end using more\n# memory than the one set via maxmemory (there are certain buffers that may\n# be larger on the replica, or data structures may sometimes take more memory\n# and so forth). So make sure you monitor your replicas and make sure they\n# have enough memory to never hit a real out-of-memory condition before the\n# master hits the configured maxmemory setting.\n#\n# replica-ignore-maxmemory yes\n\n# Redis reclaims expired keys in two ways: upon access when those keys are\n# found to be expired, and also in background, in what is called the\n# "active expire key". The key space is slowly and interactively scanned\n# looking for expired keys to reclaim, so that it is possible to free memory\n# of keys that are expired and will never be accessed again in a short time.\n#\n# The default effort of the expire cycle will try to avoid having more than\n# ten percent of expired keys still in memory, and will try to avoid consuming\n# more than 25% of total memory and to add latency to the system. However\n# it is possible to increase the expire "effort" that is normally set to\n# "1", to a greater value, up to the value "10". At its maximum value the\n# system will use more CPU, longer cycles (and technically may introduce\n# more latency), and will tolerate less already expired keys still present\n# in the system. It\'s a tradeoff between memory, CPU and latency.\n#\n# active-expire-effort 1\n\n############################# LAZY FREEING ####################################\n\n# Redis has two primitives to delete keys. One is called DEL and is a blocking\n# deletion of the object. It means that the server stops processing new commands\n# in order to reclaim all the memory associated with an object in a synchronous\n# way. If the key deleted is associated with a small object, the time needed\n# in order to execute the DEL command is very small and comparable to most other\n# O(1) or O(log_N) commands in Redis. However if the key is associated with an\n# aggregated value containing millions of elements, the server can block for\n# a long time (even seconds) in order to complete the operation.\n#\n# For the above reasons Redis also offers non blocking deletion primitives\n# such as UNLINK (non blocking DEL) and the ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and\n# FLUSHDB commands, in order to reclaim memory in background. Those commands\n# are executed in constant time. Another thread will incrementally free the\n# object in the background as fast as possible.\n#\n# DEL, UNLINK and ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and FLUSHDB are user-controlled.\n# It\'s up to the design of the application to understand when it is a good\n# idea to use one or the other. However the Redis server sometimes has to\n# delete keys or flush the whole database as a side effect of other operations.\n# Specifically Redis deletes objects independently of a user call in the\n# following scenarios:\n#\n# 1) On eviction, because of the maxmemory and maxmemory policy configurations,\n#    in order to make room for new data, without going over the specified\n#    memory limit.\n# 2) Because of expire: when a key with an associated time to live (see the\n#    EXPIRE command) must be deleted from memory.\n# 3) Because of a side effect of a command that stores data on a key that may\n#    already exist. For example the RENAME command may delete the old key\n#    content when it is replaced with another one. Similarly SUNIONSTORE\n#    or SORT with STORE option may delete existing keys. The SET command\n#    itself removes any old content of the specified key in order to replace\n#    it with the specified string.\n# 4) During replication, when a replica performs a full resynchronization with\n#    its master, the content of the whole database is removed in order to\n#    load the RDB file just transferred.\n#\n# In all the above cases the default is to delete objects in a blocking way,\n# like if DEL was called. However you can configure each case specifically\n# in order to instead release memory in a non-blocking way like if UNLINK\n# was called, using the following configuration directives.\n\nlazyfree-lazy-eviction no\nlazyfree-lazy-expire no\nlazyfree-lazy-server-del no\nreplica-lazy-flush no\n\n# It is also possible, for the case when to replace the user code DEL calls\n# with UNLINK calls is not easy, to modify the default behavior of the DEL\n# command to act exactly like UNLINK, using the following configuration\n# directive:\n\nlazyfree-lazy-user-del no\n\n# FLUSHDB, FLUSHALL, SCRIPT FLUSH and FUNCTION FLUSH support both asynchronous and synchronous\n# deletion, which can be controlled by passing the [SYNC|ASYNC] flags into the\n# commands. When neither flag is passed, this directive will be used to determine\n# if the data should be deleted asynchronously.\n\nlazyfree-lazy-user-flush no\n\n################################ THREADED I/O #################################\n\n# Redis is mostly single threaded, however there are certain threaded\n# operations such as UNLINK, slow I/O accesses and other things that are\n# performed on side threads.\n#\n# Now it is also possible to handle Redis clients socket reads and writes\n# in different I/O threads. Since especially writing is so slow, normally\n# Redis users use pipelining in order to speed up the Redis performances per\n# core, and spawn multiple instances in order to scale more. Using I/O\n# threads it is possible to easily speedup two times Redis without resorting\n# to pipelining nor sharding of the instance.\n#\n# By default threading is disabled, we suggest enabling it only in machines\n# that have at least 4 or more cores, leaving at least one spare core.\n# Using more than 8 threads is unlikely to help much. We also recommend using\n# threaded I/O only if you actually have performance problems, with Redis\n# instances being able to use a quite big percentage of CPU time, otherwise\n# there is no point in using this feature.\n#\n# So for instance if you have a four cores boxes, try to use 2 or 3 I/O\n# threads, if you have a 8 cores, try to use 6 threads. In order to\n# enable I/O threads use the following configuration directive:\n#\n# io-threads 4\n#\n# Setting io-threads to 1 will just use the main thread as usual.\n# When I/O threads are enabled, we only use threads for writes, that is\n# to thread the write(2) syscall and transfer the client buffers to the\n# socket. However it is also possible to enable threading of reads and\n# protocol parsing using the following configuration directive, by setting\n# it to yes:\n#\n# io-threads-do-reads no\n#\n# Usually threading reads doesn\'t help much.\n#\n# NOTE 1: This configuration directive cannot be changed at runtime via\n# CONFIG SET. Also, this feature currently does not work when SSL is\n# enabled.\n#\n# NOTE 2: If you want to test the Redis speedup using redis-benchmark, make\n# sure you also run the benchmark itself in threaded mode, using the\n# --threads option to match the number of Redis threads, otherwise you\'ll not\n# be able to notice the improvements.\n\n############################ KERNEL OOM CONTROL ##############################\n\n# On Linux, it is possible to hint the kernel OOM killer on what processes\n# should be killed first when out of memory.\n#\n# Enabling this feature makes Redis actively control the oom_score_adj value\n# for all its processes, depending on their role. The default scores will\n# attempt to have background child processes killed before all others, and\n# replicas killed before masters.\n#\n# Redis supports these options:\n#\n# no:       Don\'t make changes to oom-score-adj (default).\n# yes:      Alias to "relative" see below.\n# absolute: Values in oom-score-adj-values are written as is to the kernel.\n# relative: Values are used relative to the initial value of oom_score_adj when\n#           the server starts and are then clamped to a range of -1000 to 1000.\n#           Because typically the initial value is 0, they will often match the\n#           absolute values.\noom-score-adj no\n\n# When oom-score-adj is used, this directive controls the specific values used\n# for master, replica and background child processes. Values range -2000 to\n# 2000 (higher means more likely to be killed).\n#\n# Unprivileged processes (not root, and without CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capabilities)\n# can freely increase their value, but not decrease it below its initial\n# settings. This means that setting oom-score-adj to "relative" and setting the\n# oom-score-adj-values to positive values will always succeed.\noom-score-adj-values 0 200 800\n\n\n#################### KERNEL transparent hugepage CONTROL ######################\n\n# Usually the kernel Transparent Huge Pages control is set to "madvise" or\n# or "never" by default (/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled), in which\n# case this config has no effect. On systems in which it is set to "always",\n# redis will attempt to disable it specifically for the redis process in order\n# to avoid latency problems specifically with fork(2) and CoW.\n# If for some reason you prefer to keep it enabled, you can set this config to\n# "no" and the kernel global to "always".\n\ndisable-thp yes\n\n############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################\n\n# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is\n# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or\n# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on\n# the configured save points).\n#\n# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides\n# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy\n# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a\n# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something\n# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is\n# still running correctly.\n#\n# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.\n# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file\n# with the better durability guarantees.\n#\n# Please check https://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.\n\nappendonly no\n\n# The base name of the append only file.\n#\n# Redis 7 and newer use a set of append-only files to persist the dataset\n# and changes applied to it. There are two basic types of files in use:\n#\n# - Base files, which are a snapshot representing the complete state of the\n#   dataset at the time the file was created. Base files can be either in\n#   the form of RDB (binary serialized) or AOF (textual commands).\n# - Incremental files, which contain additional commands that were applied\n#   to the dataset following the previous file.\n#\n# In addition, manifest files are used to track the files and the order in\n# which they were created and should be applied.\n#\n# Append-only file names are created by Redis following a specific pattern.\n# The file name\'s prefix is based on the \'appendfilename\' configuration\n# parameter, followed by additional information about the sequence and type.\n#\n# For example, if appendfilename is set to appendonly.aof, the following file\n# names could be derived:\n#\n# - appendonly.aof.1.base.rdb as a base file.\n# - appendonly.aof.1.incr.aof, appendonly.aof.2.incr.aof as incremental files.\n# - appendonly.aof.manifest as a manifest file.\n\nappendfilename "appendonly.aof"\n\n# For convenience, Redis stores all persistent append-only files in a dedicated\n# directory. The name of the directory is determined by the appenddirname\n# configuration parameter.\n\nappenddirname "appendonlydir"\n\n# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk\n# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush\n# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.\n#\n# Redis supports three different modes:\n#\n# no: don\'t fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.\n# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.\n# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.\n#\n# The default is "everysec", as that\'s usually the right compromise between\n# speed and data safety. It\'s up to you to understand if you can relax this to\n# "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when\n# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of\n# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that\'s snapshotting),\n# or on the contrary, use "always" that\'s very slow but a bit safer than\n# everysec.\n#\n# More details please check the following article:\n# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html\n#\n# If unsure, use "everysec".\n\n# appendfsync always\nappendfsync everysec\n# appendfsync no\n\n# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background\n# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is\n# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations\n# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for\n# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block\n# our synchronous write(2) call.\n#\n# In order to mitigate this problem it\'s possible to use the following option\n# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a\n# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.\n#\n# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is\n# the same as "appendfsync no". In practical terms, this means that it is\n# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the\n# default Linux settings).\n#\n# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as\n# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.\n\nno-appendfsync-on-rewrite no\n\n# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.\n# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling\n# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.\n#\n# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the\n# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of\n# the AOF at startup is used).\n#\n# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is\n# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered.

In order to start a Redis instance as a\n# cluster node enable the cluster support uncommenting the following:\n#\n# cluster-enabled yes\n\n# Every cluster node has a cluster configuration file. This file is not\n# intended to be edited by hand. It is created and updated by Redis nodes.\n# Every Redis Cluster node requires a different cluster configuration file.\n# Make sure that instances running in the same system do not have\n# overlapping cluster configuration file names.\n#\n# cluster-config-file nodes-6379.conf\n\n# Cluster node timeout is the amount of milliseconds a node must be unreachable\n# for it to be considered in failure state.\n# Most other internal time limits are a multiple of the node timeout.\n#\n# cluster-node-timeout 15000\n\n# The cluster port is the port that the cluster bus will listen for inbound connections on. When set\n# to the default value, 0, it will be bound to the command port + 10000. Setting this value requires\n# you to specify the cluster bus port when executing cluster meet.\n# cluster-port 0\n\n# A replica of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data\n# looks too old.\n#\n# There is no simple way for a replica to actually have an exact measure of\n# its "data age", so the following two checks are performed:\n#\n# 1) If there are multiple replicas able to failover, they exchange messages\n#    in order to try to give an advantage to the replica with the best\n#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).\n#    Replicas will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start\n#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.\n#\n# 2) Every single replica computes the time of the last interaction with\n#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master\n#    is still in the "connected" state), or the time that elapsed since the\n#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).\n#    If the last interaction is too old, the replica will not try to failover\n#    at all.\n#\n# The point "2" can be tuned by user. Specifically a replica will not perform\n# the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time\n# elapsed is greater than:\n#\n#   (node-timeout * cluster-replica-validity-factor) + repl-ping-replica-period\n#\n# So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the cluster-replica-validity-factor\n# is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-replica-period of 10 seconds, the\n# replica will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master\n# for longer than 310 seconds.\n#\n# A large cluster-replica-validity-factor may allow replicas with too old data to failover\n# a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to\n# elect a replica at all.\n#\n# For maximum availability, it is possible to set the cluster-replica-validity-factor\n# to a value of 0, which means, that replicas will always try to failover the\n# master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.\n# (However they\'ll always try to apply a delay proportional to their\n# offset rank).\n#\n# Zero is the only value able to guarantee that when all the partitions heal\n# the cluster will always be able to continue.\n#\n# cluster-replica-validity-factor 10\n\n# Cluster replicas are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters\n# that are left without working replicas. This improves the cluster ability\n# to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can\'t be failed over\n# in case of failure if it has no working replicas.\n#\n# Replicas migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a\n# given number of other working replicas for their old master. This number\n# is the "migration barrier". A migration barrier of 1 means that a replica\n# will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working replica for its master\n# and so forth. It usually reflects the number of replicas you want for every\n# master in your cluster.\n#\n# Default is 1 (replicas migrate only if their masters remain with at least\n# one replica). To disable migration just set it to a very large value or\n# set cluster-allow-replica-migration to \'no\'.\n# A value of 0 can be set but is useful only for debugging and dangerous\n# in production.\n#\n# cluster-migration-barrier 1\n\n# Turning off this option allows to use less automatic cluster configuration.\n# It both disables migration to orphaned masters and migration from masters\n# that became empty.\n#\n# Default is \'yes\' (allow automatic migrations).\n#\n# cluster-allow-replica-migration yes\n\n# By default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries if they detect there\n# is at least a hash slot uncovered (no available node is serving it).\n# This way if the cluster is partially down (for example a range of hash slots\n# are no longer covered) all the cluster becomes, eventually, unavailable.\n# It automatically returns available as soon as all the slots are covered again.\n#\n# However sometimes you want the subset of the cluster which is working,\n# to continue to accept queries for the part of the key space that is still\n# covered. In order to do so, just set the cluster-require-full-coverage\n# option to no.\n#\n# cluster-require-full-coverage yes\n\n# This option, when set to yes, prevents replicas from trying to failover its\n# master during master failures. However the replica can still perform a\n# manual failover, if forced to do so.\n#\n# This is useful in different scenarios, especially in the case of multiple\n# data center operations, where we want one side to never be promoted if not\n# in the case of a total DC failure.\n#\n# cluster-replica-no-failover no\n\n# This option, when set to yes, allows nodes to serve read traffic while the\n# cluster is in a down state, as long as it believes it owns the slots.\n#\n# This is useful for two cases.  The first case is for when an application\n# doesn\'t require consistency of data during node failures or network partitions.\n# One example of this is a cache, where as long as the node has the data it\n# should be able to serve it.\n#\n# The second use case is for configurations that don\'t meet the recommended\n# three shards but want to enable cluster mode and scale later. A\n# master outage in a 1 or 2 shard configuration causes a read/write outage to the\n# entire cluster without this option set, with it set there is only a write outage.\n# Without a quorum of masters, slot ownership will not change automatically.\n#\n# cluster-allow-reads-when-down no\n\n# This option, when set to yes, allows nodes to serve pubsub shard traffic while\n# the cluster is in a down state, as long as it believes it owns the slots.\n#\n# This is useful if the application would like to use the pubsub feature even when\n# the cluster global stable state is not OK. If the application wants to make sure only\n# one shard is serving a given channel, this feature should be kept as yes.\n#\n# cluster-allow-pubsubshard-when-down yes\n\n# Cluster link send buffer limit is the limit on the memory usage of an individual\n# cluster bus link\'s send buffer in bytes.

This can happen in certain\n# networking situations where there are multiple possible routes to the node, and the\n# server doesn\'t know which one the client took.

The\n# following four options are used for this scope, and are:\n#\n# * cluster-announce-ip\n# * cluster-announce-port\n# * cluster-announce-tls-port\n# * cluster-announce-bus-port\n#\n# Each instructs the node about its address, client ports (for connections\n# without and with TLS) and cluster message bus port. The information is then\n# published in the header of the bus packets so that other nodes will be able to\n# correctly map the address of the node publishing the information.\n#\n# If tls-cluster is set to yes and cluster-announce-tls-port is omitted or set\n# to zero, then cluster-announce-port refers to the TLS port. Note also that\n# cluster-announce-tls-port has no effect if tls-cluster is set to no.\n#\n# If the above options are not used, the normal Redis Cluster auto-detection\n# will be used instead.\n#\n# Note that when remapped, the bus port may not be at the fixed offset of\n# clients port + 10000, so you can specify any port and bus-port depending\n# on how they get remapped. If the bus-port is not set, a fixed offset of\n# 10000 will be used as usual.\n#\n# Example:\n#\n# cluster-announce-ip 10.1.1.5\n# cluster-announce-tls-port 6379\n# cluster-announce-port 0\n# cluster-announce-bus-port 6380\n\n################################## SLOW LOG ###################################\n\n# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified\n# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations\n# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,\n# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only\n# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve\n# other requests in the meantime).\n#\n# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis\n# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the\n# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the\n# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the\n# queue of logged commands.\n\n# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent\n# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while\n# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.\nslowlog-log-slower-than 10000\n\n# There is no limit to this length.

However you can change this limit\n# here, but must be 1mb or greater\n#\n# proto-max-bulk-len 512mb\n\n# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like\n# closing connections of clients in timeout, purging expired keys that are\n# never requested, and so forth.\n#\n# Not all tasks are performed with the same frequency, but Redis checks for\n# tasks to perform according to the specified "hz" value.\n#\n# By default "hz" is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when\n# Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when\n# there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be\n# handled with more precision.\n#\n# The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not\n# a good idea. Most users should use the default of 10 and raise this up to\n# 100 only in environments where very low latency is required.\nhz 10\n\n# Normally it is useful to have an HZ value which is proportional to the\n# number of clients connected. This is useful in order, for instance, to\n# avoid too many clients are processed for each background task invocation\n# in order to avoid latency spikes.\n#\n# Since the default HZ value by default is conservatively set to 10, Redis\n# offers, and enables by default, the ability to use an adaptive HZ value\n# which will temporarily raise when there are many connected clients.\n#\n# When dynamic HZ is enabled, the actual configured HZ will be used\n# as a baseline, but multiples of the configured HZ value will be actually\n# used as needed once more clients are connected. In this way an idle\n# instance will use very little CPU time while a busy instance will be\n# more responsive.\ndynamic-hz yes\n\n# When a child rewrites the AOF file, if the following option is enabled\n# the file will be fsync-ed every 4 MB of data generated. This is useful\n# in order to commit the file to the disk more incrementally and avoid\n# big latency spikes.\naof-rewrite-incremental-fsync yes\n\n# When redis saves RDB file, if the following option is enabled\n# the file will be fsync-ed every 4 MB of data generated. This is useful\n# in order to commit the file to the disk more incrementally and avoid\n# big latency spikes.\nrdb-save-incremental-fsync yes\n\n# Redis LFU eviction (see maxmemory setting) can be tuned. However it is a good\n# idea to start with the default settings and only change them after investigating\n# how to improve the performances and how the keys LFU change over time, which\n# is possible to inspect via the OBJECT FREQ command.\n#\n# There are two tunable parameters in the Redis LFU implementation: the\n# counter logarithm factor and the counter decay time. It is important to\n# understand what the two parameters mean before changing them.\n#\n# The LFU counter is just 8 bits per key, it\'s maximum value is 255, so Redis\n# uses a probabilistic increment with logarithmic behavior. Given the value\n# of the old counter, when a key is accessed, the counter is incremented in\n# this way:\n#\n# 1. A random number R between 0 and 1 is extracted.\n# 2. A probability P is calculated as 1/(old_value*lfu_log_factor+1).\n# 3. The counter is incremented only if R < P.\n#\n# The default lfu-log-factor is 10. This is a table of how the frequency\n# counter changes with a different number of accesses with different\n# logarithmic factors:\n#\n# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+\n# | factor | 100 hits   | 1000 hits  | 100K hits  | 1M hits    | 10M hits   |\n# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+\n# | 0      | 104        | 255        | 255        | 255        | 255        |\n# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+\n# | 1      | 18         | 49         | 255        | 255        | 255        |\n# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+\n# | 10     | 10         | 18         | 142        | 255        | 255        |\n# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+\n# | 100    | 8          | 11         | 49         | 143        | 255        |\n# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+\n#\n# NOTE: The above table was obtained by running the following commands:\n#\n#   redis-benchmark -n 1000000 incr foo\n#   redis-cli object freq foo\n#\n# NOTE 2: The counter initial value is 5 in order to give new objects a chance\n# to accumulate hits.\n#\n# The counter decay time is the time, in minutes, that must elapse in order\n# for the key counter to be decremented.\n#\n# The default value for the lfu-decay-time is 1. A special value of 0 means we\n# will never decay the counter.\n#\n# lfu-log-factor 10\n# lfu-decay-time 1\n\n########################### ACTIVE DEFRAGMENTATION #######################\n#\n# What is active defragmentation?\n# -------------------------------\n#\n# Active (online) defragmentation allows a Redis server to compact the\n# spaces left between small allocations and deallocations of data in memory,\n# thus allowing to reclaim back memory.\n#\n# Fragmentation is a natural process that happens with every allocator (but\n# less so with Jemalloc, fortunately) and certain workloads. Normally a server\n# restart is needed in order to lower the fragmentation, or at least to flush\n# away all the data and create it again. However thanks to this feature\n# implemented by Oran Agra for Redis 4.0 this process can happen at runtime\n# in a "hot" way, while the server is running.\n#\n# Basically when the fragmentation is over a certain level (see the\n# configuration options below) Redis will start to create new copies of the\n# values in contiguous memory regions by exploiting certain specific Jemalloc\n# features (in order to understand if an allocation is causing fragmentation\n# and to allocate it in a better place), and at the same time, will release the\n# old copies of the data. This process, repeated incrementally for all the keys\n# will cause the fragmentation to drop back to normal values.\n#\n# Important things to understand:\n#\n# 1. This feature is disabled by default, and only works if you compiled Redis\n#    to use the copy of Jemalloc we ship with the source code of Redis.\n#    This is the default with Linux builds.\n#\n# 2. You never need to enable this feature if you don\'t have fragmentation\n#    issues.\n#\n# 3. Once you experience fragmentation, you can enable this feature when\n#    needed with the command "CONFIG SET activedefrag yes".\n#\n# The configuration parameters are able to fine tune the behavior of the\n# defragmentation process. If you are not sure about what they mean it is\n# a good idea to leave the defaults untouched.\n\n# Active defragmentation is disabled by default\n# activedefrag no\n\n# Minimum amount of fragmentation waste to start active defrag\n# active-defrag-ignore-bytes 100mb\n\n# Minimum percentage of fragmentation to start active defrag\n# active-defrag-threshold-lower 10\n\n# Maximum percentage of fragmentation at which we use maximum effort\n# active-defrag-threshold-upper 100\n\n# Minimal effort for defrag in CPU percentage, to be used when the lower\n# threshold is reached\n# active-defrag-cycle-min 1\n\n# Maximal effort for defrag in CPU percentage, to be used when the upper\n# threshold is reached\n# active-defrag-cycle-max 25\n\n# Maximum number of set/hash/zset/list fields that will be processed from\n# the main dictionary scan\n# active-defrag-max-scan-fields 1000\n\n# Jemalloc background thread for purging will be enabled by default\njemalloc-bg-thread yes\n\n# It is possible to pin different threads and processes of Redis to specific\n# CPUs in your system, in order to maximize the performances of the server.\n# This is useful both in order to pin different Redis threads in different\n# CPUs, but also in order to make sure that multiple Redis instances running\n# in the same host will be pinned to different CPUs.\n#\n# Normally you can do this using the "taskset" command, however it is also\n# possible to this via Redis configuration directly, both in Linux and FreeBSD.\n#\n# You can pin the server/IO threads, bio threads, aof rewrite child process, and\n# the bgsave child process. The syntax to specify the cpu list is the same as\n# the taskset command:\n#\n# Set redis server/io threads to cpu affinity 0,2,4,6:\n# server_cpulist 0-7:2\n#\n# Set bio threads to cpu affinity 1,3:\n# bio_cpulist 1,3\n#\n# Set aof rewrite child process to cpu affinity 8,9,10,11:\n# aof_rewrite_cpulist 8-11\n#\n# Set bgsave child process to cpu affinity 1,10,11\n# bgsave_cpulist 1,10-11\n\n# In some cases redis will emit warnings and even refuse to start if it detects\n# that the system is in bad state, it is possible to suppress these warnings\n# by setting the following config which takes a space delimited list of warnings\n# to suppress\n#\n# ignore-warnings ARM64-COW-BUG\n'})})]})}function h(e={}){let{wrapper:n}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,s.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},17776:function(e,n,t){t.d(n,{R:()=>o,x:()=>r});var i=t(7378);let s={},a=i.createContext(s);function o(e){let n=i.useContext(a);return i.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}},[n,e])}function r(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:o(e.components),i.createElement(a.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
